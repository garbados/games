title: Budget Dungeons

## Fantasy roleplaying on the cheap.

# Quickstart

1. Pick the Storyteller. See "Overview: The Storyteller" for what this person does.
2. Everyone else: Make characters; see "Characters: Creating Characters" for how.
3. Play!

# Overview

## Players

## The Storyteller

This person acts the parts of all characters and entities not otherwise controlled by the players, and takes a lead role in describing the world around the players' characters.

## Traits

Traits describe your character's abilities and personality. They may include words like strong, wise, corrupt, annoying, frail, etc. Wherever they help you, things are easier. Roleplaying your traits well earns Story Points, the currency of storytelling. See "Overview: Story Points" for more on that.

When you undertake actions, describe them. If your description makes your traits relevant and useful, they make the action easier. See "Overview: Contests" for how traits interact with actions in more detail.

If you have a single trait many times, it makes that trait more potent. BD refers to different degrees of a trait by how many times you have that trait:

* 0: not [trait]
* 1: [trait]
* 2: very [trait]
* 3: incredibly [trait]
* 4: unbelievably [trait]
* 5: the [trait]est

## Story Points

Using your traits in creative and dangerous ways earns you story points. Specifically, the Storyteller awards players with story points in return for creating dramatic tension, creative use of traits, detailed descriptions of an action, etc., score story points. Other players can prompt the Storyteller to action by nominating their comrades to receive story points.

Story points can be used for one of two things:

* Raise one trait up two degrees for the purposes of a single action. This bonus disappears after the action resolves.
* Flesh out the world. This can include detailing your family history, the layout of the castle you're sieging, or the personality of a character you just met. Use your imagination!

## Contests

When two entities -- whether two or more characters, one or more characters and one or more inanimate objects, or just a bunch of rocks -- try to foist their will onto one another, it's called a contest. If a thief tries to lockpick a door, he or she contests the lock. If the thief wins, the door unlocks. If the lock wins, the thief lacks the ability to pick the lock.

To run a contest:

1. Participants describe their action, and sum their relevant traits, plus or minus any circumstantial factors. The sum is called the bonus.
2. Subtract the smallest bonus from every participant's; thus, whoever had the smallest bonus now has a bonus of zero.
3. Engage in rock/paper/scissors. 
  a. To defeat a participant, you must win more rounds than they have bonus. Thus, to defeat a participant with zero bonus, you must win once. 
  b. To be defeated, you must have lost at least once. Thus, a participant with zero bonus plays until they lose, while whoever has the highest bonus continues playing until someone has won more times than their bonus AND they have lost at least once.
  c. If there are more than two participants, it is possible for all parties to lose. If, say, three drunks try to punch each other -- one throws Rock, one throws Paper, one throws Scissors -- they all beat someone, and are beat in turn.
  d. Participants can, by consensus, end the contest at any time. Whoever was defeated at that point stays defeated. If the contest doesn't end voluntarily, then the last one standing wins.
4. Some form of the winner's / winners' described action(s) comes to pass, perhaps with nods to how the contest went. For example, if there was a particularly long series of draws between two participants, the Storyteller may tell of the "long back-and-forth" between them.

If the contest happens between groups or distinct entities (like the party and a gang of bandits), you can lump the groups together to speed up resolution:

1. Participants describe their action, and sum their relevant traits, like normal.
2. Each group sums the bonuses of its constituents, and chooses a representative to rock/paper/scissors for them.
3. These representatives duke it out like normal.

## Turns

Players take turns speaking, proceeding around the group so that each person in order has a chance to act, speak, or otherwise participate. If a player doesn't want to, they can always pass.

# Characters

## Creating Characters

1. Pick a race
2. Pick a class
3. Pick another trait
4. Select your gear
5. Come up with a name and simple backstory

## Character Development

Every once in a while, such as after a quest or a major revelation, characters learn and grow, expanding their abilities:

1. Pick a Trait, or improve one you already have
2. Get a Story Point

# Races

Races are typified by several common-but-not-always-present traits. Members of a race will show some facet of the race's overall character, but probably not every facet. Thus, races have several traits; when a player selects a race for their character, they choose only one of those traits from among the three listed. This chosen trait is added to your character.

Sometimes, a race will have a particularly nasty negative trait, such as blindness for troglodytes, which all members of the race possess. In this case, choose two traits from among the four listed, in addition to the negative trait.

* Human: cunning, charismatic, creative.
* Elf: elegant, beautiful, frail.
* Dwarf: proud, brave, hardy.
* Halfling: sly, proud, quick.
* Gnome: inventive, nimble, brash.
* Orc: strong, violent, commanding.
* Goblin: lucky, hardy, annoying.
* Troglodyte: Blind, and: hardy, keen senses, stealthy, strong.
* Infernal: Cursed (-1 whenever dealing with divine forces), and: sadistic, cunning, beautiful, charismatic.

# Classes

Classes are professions and skillsets acquired before the game has started. They imply a community from whom you received training, and relationships with that community. Like races, classes normally list three traits; when a player selects a class for their character, they pick two of these traits. As with races, add the chosen traits to your character.

* Soldier: strong, disciplined, commanding.
* Cleric: corrupt, charismatic, divine*.
* Mage: intelligent, learned, sorcerous*.
* Barbarian: strong, wild, keen senses.
* Druid: wise, compassionate, natural*.
* Bard: charismatic, romantic, artistic.
* Rogue: stealthy, cunning, deadly.
* Monk: disciplined, calm, mundane*.

* Relevant to spellcasting. See "Magic" for details.

# Magic

There are four schools of magic, as follows:

* Divine: invoke the powers of the firmament, and become a channel for heavenly powers.
* Sorcerous: exploit the potent energies of mana, a force capable of bending time and space.
* Natural: commune with the natural world and call on the spirits therein for aid.
* Mundane: stamp out magical energies and influences by sheer force of will.

Each school of magic has five tiers, corresponding with the five degrees of a trait, and labelled in a similar way:

1. Novice
2. Apprentice
3. Journeyman
4. Expert
5. Master

You can cast spells from tiers equal to or less than your degree in the relevant trait. For example, a very divine character can cast novice and apprentice divine spells.

When you cast a spell, you contest it. A spell's bonus is equal to its tier. You can raise and lower a spell's bonus by changing its nature:

* -1 per extra turn you take to cast a spell, up to -2
* +1 to cast without moving
* +1 to cast silently

Each tier of magic has two spells, for ten spells per school (and forty spells total).
