# BUDGET DUNGEONS

Rather than use numbers like some DnD clone, BD stays close to its ADA core. Classes, races, gods and alignments are treated as traits, or collections thereof. Mixing and matching them to greatest benefit falls to the player, though the best path, as with any ADA module, is ultimately to do simply what sounds like the most fun. In this way, BD becomes an ADA module for combat-heavy fantasy more than a lightweight DnD alternative.

# Characters

## Making a character

To begin, each player who isn't the storyteller needs a character.

1. Pick a race
2. Pick a class
3. Pick your own Trait
4. Select your gear
5. Come up with a name and simple backstory

## Levelling up

Every once in a while, such as after a quest or a major revelation, characters level up.

1. Pick a Trait, or improve one you already have
2. Get a Story Point

## Traits

Traits describe your character's ability and personality. They may include words like strong, wise, corrupt, annoying, frail, etc. Wherever they help you, things are easier. Roleplaying your traits well earns Story Points, the currency of storytelling.

When you undertake actions, describe them. If your description makes your traits relevant and useful, they make the action easier. See `Contests` for how traits interact with actions in more detail.

If you have a single trait many times, it makes that trait more potent. BD refers to different degrees of a trait by how many times you have that trait:

* 0: not [trait]
* 1: [trait]
* 2: very [trait]
* 3: incredibly [trait]
* 4: unbelievably [trait]
* 5: the [trait]est

## Story Points
	
Using your traits in creative and dangerous ways earns you story points. Good roleplaying, creative thinking, etc., score story points.

# Races

## Basic Races

* Human
  Pick one trait: cunning, charismatic, creative.

## Custom Races

Framework: three traits, pick one. Your character bears all the facets of one of his race, but is most keenly affected by the chosen trait. Some races may have especially nasty negative traits. In return they bestow two positive racial traits instead of one, and have four possible traits instead of one.

# Classes

  Pick two traits: strong, disciplined, commanding.
* Cleric
  Pick two traits: corrupt, charismatic, divine.

  Pick two traits: strong, wild, keen senses.
* Druid

* Bard
  Pick two traits: charismatic, romantic, artistic.
* Rogue
  Pick two traits: stealthy, cunning, deadly.
* Monk
  Pick two traits: disciplined, calm, mundane.
* Warlock
  Cursed; divine magic is more effective against you.
  Pick three traits: sadistic, cunning, mancer, mundane.

## Custom Classes

Framework: three traits, pick two. Your character bears all the facets of his class, but is most keenly affected by the chosen traits. Some classes have particularly nasty negative traits, and as a result bestow three positive traits instead of two.

# Note on Connections
	
Beyond traits gained, being part of a specific race or class bestows you with connections therein. You know how to talk to others of your own race or class, and may have related contacts when encountering cities, towns, and other areas that might house your kin. It would be feasible, for example, for a cleric to know someone when visiting a monastary, even if the adventure had never taken the party there.

# Contests

# Combat

# Magic

Magic in BD stems from a few special traits, specifically "divine" "mancer" "naturalist" and "mundane". Characters with these traits have access to magic of various orders.

* Divine: allows the character to invoke the powers of the firmament, and become a channel for their awesome power.
* Mancer: allows the character to exploit the potent energies of mana, a poorly understood force capable of bending time and space.
* Naturalist: allows the character to commune with the natural world and call on the spirits therein for aid.
* Mundane: allows the character to stamp out magical energies and influences by sheer force of will.

All magic takes mental concentration to cast. You can augment your casting by taking extra time to cast it; you can also augment the nature of the spell by making it more difficult to cast.

* +1 per extra turn you take to cast a spell, up to +2
* -1 to cast without moving
* -1 to cast silently

Each manner of magic has five tiers, with two spells each. You can cast spells from tiers equal to or less than the degree of the relevant casting trait. For example, if your character is very divine (2 degrees of divine), you can cast spells from the first and second tier.
