title: Budget Dungeons

## Fantasy roleplaying on the cheap.

Priorities:
	Don't worry so much about number crunching. First off, it's ADA, and therefore lightweight. Second, your target audience are DnDers, who live to crunch numbers. (luddites, philistines, accountants, all of them!)
	Accordingly, "Dragons For Less" characters will consist of more fields and more structured numbers, but gameplay itself won't be any more thought-provoking than the core.
	The game itself should be more structured, too. Heirarchies of super fields and sub fields break up attributes and classes so that characters can be easily summed up, drafted, and advanced. What each field applies to should be set out so as to minimize overlap, while also covering our DnD bases.
	Propose some different dice models to explore the following concepts:
		Rolling lots of dice
			Model 1: each +1 becomes +1d6. Simple, elegant, chaotic, big. DCs also scale easily, where each +1 in difficulty = +3 DC.
				Easy		3
				Moderate	6
				Challenging	9
				Hard		12
				Legendary	15
				Impossible	18
		Rolling different sizes of dice
			Model 1: check using 1d(2+2*mod), where mod is the character's effective bonus. If the bonus is negative, instead use 1d(2+mod). If mod < -3, character auto-fails. Relatively fast, but what happens when mod > 5? Limiting growth to no greater than +5 would invite diversifying your character's assets, but I'm not sure if that's what we want.
				DCs scale well, though. Of a given mod, DC = 2+mod.
					Easy		0
					Moderate	1
					Challenging	2
					Hard		3
					Legendary	4
					Impossible	5
					Varying degrees of "impossible" further affect the DC.
				Oh! Here's how you handle mod > 5: beyond d12, +1 bonus = straight up +1. Likewise, you can reduce the size of the die you're using in exchange for a +1. So, 1d6 = 1d4+1. If mod >= 10, you can choose to start rolling d20s, whose equivalent is mod = 10. (so mod 12 -> d20+2, d12+6, d10+7, etc) Note that you can't increase the size of your die for a negative mod, so while 1d6 = 1d4+1, 1d6 != 1d8-1.

Classes
	1	Fighter
		Talented with simple and martial weapons, and all armors. Trained by proper militaries, fighters understand essential tactics and military heirarchies.
	2	Cleric
		Keepers of the faith, clerics master the ways of their gods, whether for healing or for harm. Trained in simple weapons and divine magic.
	3	Druid
		Naturalists, elementalists, hermits and wild men, druids live out their lives pursuing balance, harmony, and understanding with the ancient and mythic spirits and forces that, even now, manage the world. Trained in simple weapons and natural magic.
	4	Mage
		Scientists and academicians, they practice the art of magery, bending time, space, and matter itself with their arcane wizardry. Trained in simple weapons and arcane magic.
	5	Bard
		More than tavern players, bards are courtiers, tale-tellers, sweet-talkers, crock-hawkers, heartfelt romantics and bald-faced liars. Trained in simple weapons and light armor.
	6	Rogue
		Talented specialists, thieves, burglars, spies, infiltrators, and other nefarious things. Trained in simple and martial weapons, and light armor.
	7	Monk
		Trained and conditioned in far-off monastaries to exert total control over the body, and therefore more effectively draw it to its full potential, monks are trained in exotic weapons, light armor, and counterspelling.
	8	Barbarian
		Berserkers and savages, the warriors of the wild. Trained in all weapons, and all armors but heavy.
	
Equipment
	Note on all weapons: two-handed stuff acts at +1.
	Simple Weapons
		Sticks, clubs, rocks, staves, maces, and other cave-people weapons.
	Martial Weapons
		Swords, axes, polearms, and other more complicated pointy things.
		Martial weapons typically act at +1 over simple weapons, before dealing with quality.
	Exotic Weapons
		Crazy two-ended things and/or things that weren't designed for combat, like chairs. If something simply wasn't made for combat, it operates at -2. (For comparison, shitty quality stuff is -1. Non-combat objects are both shitty weapons, and not weapons at all, which makes them double-shitty.)
		Crazy weapons that actually /were/ made for combat act at +0, like simple weapons, but get +2 bonuses on specific maneuvers because they're crazy like that.
	Note on all armor: "move" is a penalty where the weight of your equipment would act against you. Staying afloat, climbing, keeping your balance, etc., all suffer this penalty. Some maneuvers can even use it to hamper your defenses.
	Light Armor
		Padded armor, light leather, chainmail bikinis, etc.
		Includes bucklers and smallshields.
		+1 armor, -0 move
	Medium Armor
		Studded leather, chain shirts, hide armor, etc.
		Includes large shields, round shields, and kite shields.
		+2 armor, -1 move
	Heavy Armor
		Banded mail, half plate, full plate, etc.
		Includes tower shields.
		+3 armor, -2 move
	Spellbooks
		Spellbooks are pseudo-magical items that help casters focus their powers. They give their quality as a bonus where they apply. Note that spellbooks have a more limited scope than a whole level in the class.
		Magery: As academicians and scientists, mages build upon the discoveries of their predecessors, and then scribe their additions and innovations for future generations to likewise discover. To anyone else, the arcane symbols that span mage tomes are utterly incomprehensible, but to the trained mage, they lay out in perfect scientific and mathematical detail, the way to bring time, space, and matter itself under your command. However, each mage has their area of focus, and so too do their tomes, each containing dissertations and examinations of a particular field of magic, which mages reading it may then use and abuse to their heart's content.
		Druidry: Spirits in nature reside in all things, and interacting with them -- calling to them, persuading them, manipulating them -- is how druids work their nature magic. Certain spirits make their homes in nexus' of power called tokens, which can be anything from a particular rock or acorn with a certain distinct air about its peculiar shape, to gnarled branches bent into perfect staves whose heads inexplicably grip some precious jewel. Druids use these tokens as focuses for their power, communicating with the spirit within like it was a part of himself.
		Bibles: Each god has their Bible, a text containing their Word and Decree, summing up through tale, fable, warning, and prophecy, the god's mission and meaning. To the layman, Bibles read like a religious text: sometimes dry, sometimes graphic, sometimes brilliant, and sometimes crazy. But clerics are trained in reading and following the words of gods, and can use Bibles to augment their divine arsenals.
	Tools
		Check out the d20SRD list of miscellaneous equipment for good ideas on tools. Any variable in an item, such as how far a torch shines, is determined by quality, and therefore price. GMs are adviced to ad-hoc that shit like it's going out of style.
	Price of Equipment
		Cost = 10 * Quality^2 gp, where quality is at least 1.
		Why the 10? So you can drop gold on players more easily. Change it to 100 if you're feeling frisky with the world's finances, or remove it entirely if you're a nasty scrooge.
		Typically, stuff sells for half of what you bought it for.
	
Character Creation
	Pick a race OR roll 1d6 and choose the corresponding race.
	Pick three attributes: two of them, you're good at, and get +1 wherever it applies. The third, you're bad at, and it gives -1 where it applies. OR roll 3d6, one at a time, with each die corresponding to a trait. If you roll the same trait twice, reroll until you get one you haven't picked.
	Pick a class, or roll 1d6 and choose the corresponding class.
	Get 20 * level^2 gp, spend if you're so inclined. Mod the coefficient as you see fit to mess with party finances. (Match starting gold to the cost of items. If your mod on quality costs is 1 instead of 10, the starting gold mod should be 2 instead of 20.)
	Come up with a name.
	Ponder a backstory.
	You're done!
	
Combat
	Attack
		STR + Stuff vs. DEX + Stuff
	Feint
		Same roll as Attack
		Instead of dealing damage, your attack reduces the target's defense by your margin of success plus his/her move penalty.
	Disarm
		STR + Stuff vs. 1.5 * (DEX + Stuff)
		Instead of dealing damage, if you succeed, you disarm your foe, sending their weapon flying five yards (spaces) in some direction.
		Related: picking up your weapon, or any other object, is an action, though it can be performed as part of, say, a move action.
	Grapple
		STR + Stuff vs. DEX or STR + Stuff
		If your attack succeeds, you start wrasslin' your opponent, preventing either from targeting anyone but each other. You occupy the same space, and reduce your defense by your move penalty. Attacks against either participant have a 25% chance of hitting the other instead (roll 1d4 if you hit. On a 1, you hit the wrong guy.) Any weapons larger than a dagger have a hell of a time being used, and suffer -1, and two-handed weapons simply can't be used.
	Move
		Move 10 yards (spaces) minus your move penalty.
	Charge
		Take a move action ending at a target, who you promptly decide to give what for and attack. Reduce your defense by your move penalty until your next turn.
	Ready
		Ready an action. When its condition is met (ex "someone gets close"), perform it immediately at +1.

Magic
	Each school of magic has six sub-fields, which spellbooks specialize in. Levels in the class don't specialize, on the other hand.

			Manipulation of force and energy.
		Evocation
			Creation of force and energy.

			Manipulation of space.
		Chronomancy
			Manipulation of time.
	Natural
		Elementalism. Uses wisdom.

		Delisatris
			God of elves, the oldest being, the observer and muse. His infinite lifetime grants him the knowledge and experience to intuit the unknown, foresee the future, and discern the hidden. Calling upon his powers can be used to perform divination.

He inspires his followers to assume likewise mythic forms, or imbue them upon the world around them. Calling upon his powers can be used to perform transmutation.
		Beloth
			God of dwarves, the deepest being. Lying within his coccoon of rock and stone that we call Terra, Beloth slumbers, dreaming. Having forged Terra to warm his cold hard body in seas of magma, his followers revere his artisan craftsmanship, and aspire to their own feats of creation.
		Eenf
			God of goblins, the cleverest being.
		Bur Gro Magrog
			God of orcs, the strongest being.
		
	Counterspelling
