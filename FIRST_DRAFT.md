FIRST DRAFT a game of divine proofreading

IT IS THE DAWN OF TIME. By the will of the almighty DEUS, Creation blinks into existence, wholly intact. From whole cloth, he spins physics, matter, time, space, and energy, and sews them together to form a universe of unparalleled majesty and sophistication. Truth be told, He is quite proud of himself.

But this is also His first attempt at the forging of a Reality. Its one face, a land called Terra, stops finitely, dropping off into space, while elsewhere the landscapes and their inhabitants find themselves still wrestling with the laws of the universe to hammer out the contract of their existence. Terra's creationary energies still pulse and vibrate, bending the flow of reality even as it settles into place. Thoughts and wills ripple through Creation's divine aether, influencing the still-cooling properties of space and time, so that for all the architectural efforts of Deus, his Creation remains very much a living, breathing, changing entity.

Cool as that may sound, in today's language we would call it "buggy." Holes and errors pockmark Terra's face, and the ability of mortals to manipulate spacetime as they do, or for such properties to give life to the unliving, is wholly unintended. Often are avatars of Deus encountered across Terra's face, closing feedback loops, debugging infinite recursions, improving runtimes, and innovating new features and mechanics. If ever asked about their duties, the universe, or much of anything else, they remark, "Really, this is only the first draft. I like to think of it as 'in beta.'"

CONCEPT
	Characters are humans with mortal attributes like STRENGTH or AGILITY, in addition to WILL, which is what mortals use to manipulate the world around them, and resist being manipulated themselves.
