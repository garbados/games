summary: Get ready for some algebraic excellence.

## ADVENTURE TIME by which I mean RUNNING THE GAME

When the game begins, everyone makes a character except for whoever volunteered to be the Storyteller, Narrator, GM, DM, whatevs. That person makes a brief adventure out of the character of the person on their left (or right, if you REALLY CARE), who shall hereafter be called the Protagonist. Then, the storyteller sketches up some points (in secret) to guide the adventure before it begins:

* HOOK: what gets the party involved in this adventure? Why should they care?
* GOAL: what are they trying to achieve?
* OBSTACLE: what's stopping them?

Then the gang gets rolling.

Once the party achieves the goal, the adventure concludes. The Protagonist should recieve a BOON (that is, a good thing) relating to the nature of the adventure. The storyteller then rejoins the party while the Protagonist's player becomes the new storyteller. Repeat ad nauseum. For continuity purposes, the storyteller should find some brief and at least partially satisfying reason for why his character exits and the old storyteller's character rejoins the party. At the end of each adventure, all characters are free to change their WANT.

## Characters

All characters consist of five things: To make a character, decide what each of these five things is for that character, and you're done!

* NAME: a thing that we call you, like "Beemo" or "that kid"!
* WHAT: what you are. Examples from the show include Finn, who is a boy, or Princess Bubblegum, who is a princess. Jack is a twenty-something dog, while Ice King is an Ice King. Your WHAT is mostly for roleplaying purposes, but can also direct a story or influence your capabilities. For example, Jack is good at dog things, like digging up bones, and twenty-something things, like being a pillar of wisdom for younger ones.
* WANT: what you want. This may be as simple as "Some ice cream" to as involved as "To marry Princess Bubblegum." Roleplaying your want well can earn you story points, and can also become the basis for adventures. You can change your want at the end of each adventure.
* BOON: something good about you, or an item that helps you. Examples from the show include Finn, who's righteous, or Princess Bubble Gum, who knows science. Anywhere your BOON applies, and anywhere you can argue for it to apply (e.g. theoretically everywhere), things are easier.
* FLAW: something bad about you. Examples from the show include Finn, who's rash, or the Ice King, who's a misanthrope. Flaws are indicators for roleplaying, as well as story-point generators. Any time you roleplay particularly well, or your roleplaying leads to a significant development, failure, or success, gain a story point. Flaws are also story hooks.
* POWER: something you can do that normal people can't. Examples from the show include Jack's ability to stretch, the Ice King's lightning, or Finn's heroism. Anywhere a POWER applies, just like a BOON, things are easier. Things that are otherwise impossible become possible with POWERs. Argue for it, and try it. It works except where there's a reasonable chance of failure, or where you're being contested.

## Story Points

Using story points make you the Storyteller for a moment. Suddenly: your game, your rules.

The current Storyteller (before you temporarily dethrone him or her) awards story points based on roleplaying. If your portrayal of the Ice King's crippling misanthropy and general awkwardness is kinda creepin' everybody out, get a story point. If, as Finn, your awesomeness inspires the party to more algebraic heights, get a story point. 
	
## Bonuses and Penalties

Your WHAT and POWER determine the extent of your capabilities. Sometimes it'll make stuff harder: a small dog may have difficulty reaching the top shelf, while a space thing without hands would have similar trouble opening jars. At the GMs discretion, such hindrances may make tasks harder (-1 or -2 at most) or simply impossible. Likewise, a person can open jars like a pro, and may get a bonus (+1 or +2 at most). Where your POWER benefits you in an otherwise mundane contest, it gives +2. Likewise, your BOON gives +1 where it benefits you.

## Fortune Mechanics

When contesting something, or trying something with a reasonable chance of failure, use one of the two following systems for determining who wins and who eats dirt:
	
### Dice

Roll a six-sided die. If the die's roll plus your bonus is greater than the task's difficulty, you succeed. Ties are draws, or victory to the defender if a tie isn't possible.

Difficulty:
1. very easy
2. easy
3. moderate
4. difficult
5. hard
6. impossible

Or, in a contest, the difficulty is 3+[opponent's bonus]

### Rock/Paper/Scissors (RPS)

Rock/paper/scissors someone in the group of the storyteller's choosing. Each +1 you each have amounts to a round your opponent must win in order to stop you. The bonuses of either side cancel each other out, so that if you and your opponent both have +2, they cancel each other out into an effective +0. 

So, for example, Finn righteously leaps into the air to hero-kick the Ice King, who's trying to stick lightning bolts in Finn's kneecaps and other vital areas. Finn gets +1 for being righteous, and another +2 for using his POWER, while the Ice King gets +2 for using his POWER. This levels out to Finn with an effective +1 and the Ice King with an effective +0, so Finn has to win once to hero-kick the Ice King, while the Ice King must win twice to zap Finn.
