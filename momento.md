# Momento RPG

A memory game.

## Overview

The game always has a Subject and a Narrator. The narrator describes the world, and the subject navigates it.

The subject suffers from short-term memory loss, and can only remember what has happened during each scene, or approximately ten minutes of gameplay. After that time, the narrator become the person to the current narrator's right, and the subject becomes the person to the current subject's right.

The narrator leads the subject through the world up to the moment where the last subject began. In this way, the story moves backwards through time. Even as the players learn about the world, the subject remains unaware of everything beyond the current scene.

However, the subject always retains one vital fact, known to all players at the beginning of the game. This fact is known as the Motive.

## How to Play

First, determine a motive. It is a remnant of the subject's past, such as "Kill John G.", "My wife is not dead.", or "Get milk." Whether determined by one person or the group, the motive is known to all players.

Then, determine who will start as the Subject and Narrator. Players can volunteer, or be chosen by chance.

Lastly, start the story.

When the subject attempts actions whose success is not certain, see `Conflict Resolution`.

## Conflict Resolution

Sometimes, the subject will attempt to do things that are dangerous or difficult. If success is not certain, use a game of Three-card Monte to determine it. If the subject wins the game, their attempted action succeeds. Else, the action fails.

### Three-card Monte

Show the subject three cards. Name one of them as the mark, then rearrange them quickly for a while, in an attempt to confuse the subject. Then, the subject selects one of the cards. If they select the mark, they win. Else, they lose.

## FAQ

### Can the subject die?

Not normally. That would make all preceding scenes (as in, all future events) nonsensical. If your group can find away around this problem, then why not?

### Does the subject remember anything from their former life?

It depends on what caused the subject to lose the ability to form new memories. This question should be resolved in-game, as its answer will differ for each subject.

### What happens when the subject fulfills their motive?

How would the subject know that they had, if they can't form new memories?
