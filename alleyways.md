summary: Inspired by The Comfort of Strangers, Investigatoria is the best excuse to meet new people.

## Mack the Knife is loose again...

*...and it's up to you to stop him.*

You're standing on the T. Your phone buzzes.

*An investigator is nearby!* it reads.

Another gumshoe? Maybe now you'll get the scoop on why Dodgy Dan took the fall for Mack. You look around for the private eye, and catch the eye of someone else looking around in the same way.

"Investigator?" "Aye." You bump phones.

Your phone reads, *"Where's Dan?" you ask his dame. "He's been gone for days! We were getting married..." Poor gal. You swipe Dan's journal on the way out.* 

"Well. Dodgy Dan is likely dead."

"Who? I just started a new investigation. Professor Purple, in the library, with the golfclub."

"Oh, I like that one. I won't spoil anything."

"Thanks. So who's Dodgy Dan?"

## How to Play

*Investigatoria* is a social mystery game app. You play as an investigator, and you find clues by meeting other investigators. When you're near another player, the app tells you so. When you bump phones, you each get your next clue, and log the encounter as something like "[name] gave you a clue about [investigation] on [date]." You can get a clue from meeting the same investigator once every 24 hours.

As an investigator, you take on investigations that take the form of a mystery story that you unravel, piece by piece, by getting clues. Clues are tweet-sized bits of the story that provide the motives, alibis, and other details that will ultimately solve your case. Once you've solved a case (that is, found its last clue), your next clue begins the next case.

Physical locations can also contain clues: you might stumble across a clue on your way home that opens up a new investigation tied to real things in real places. Or, a local bookstore might sponsor Investigatoria, so when you visit the bookstore, you get your next clue.

All content comes from the community. I host writing workshops that challenge writers to compose mysteries broken into tweet-sized bits. [Contact me](mailto:garbados@gmail.com) if you'd like to know when the next one is. If you'd like to submit an investigation, [email me](mailto:garbados@gmail.com) and I'll put it in the game. All investigations are owned by their author(s); submitting an investigation just permits me to host it through Investigatoria with your permission. If you ever want to take your investigation down, [let me know](mailto:garbados@gmail.com) and I'll remove it from the game within 24 hours.

Investigatoria is currently in development, but will ultimately manifest as a phone app that reports when other investigators are nearby. If you'd like to get involved with realizing that vision, [contact me](mailto:garbados@gmail.com).
