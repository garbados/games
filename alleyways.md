## Mack the Knife is loose again...

*...and it's up to you to stop him.*

You're standing on the T. Your phone buzzes.

*An investigator is nearby!* it reads.

Another gumshoe? Maybe now you'll get the scoop on why Dodgy Dan took the fall for Mack. You look around for the private eye, and catch the eye of someone else looking around in the same way.

"Investigator?" "Aye." You bump phones.

Your phone reads, *"Where's Dan?" you ask his dame. "He's been gone for days! We were getting married..." Poor gal. You swipe Dan's journal on the way out.* 

"Well. Dodgy Dan is likely dead."

"Who? I just started a new investigation. Professor Purple, in the library, with the golfclub."

"Oh, I like that one. I won't spoil anything."

"Thanks. So who's Dodgy Dan?"

## How to Play

*Alleyways* is a social mystery game. You play as an investigator, and you find clues by meeting other investigators.

While the game is in development, you can play on Twitter: send [@AlleywaysGame](https://twitter.com/alleywaysgame) a direct message (DM) with a picture of you and another investigator as proof of your encounter, like this from @SteveJobs to @AlleywaysGame: 

"[upload.wikimedia.org/...](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Steve_Jobs_and_Bill_Gates_(522695099).jpg) @BillGates"

@AlleywaysGame will then send a clue to @SteveJobs and @BillGates.

Ultimately, *Alleyways* will be a phone app that reports when other investigators are nearby. If you'd like to get involved with realizing that vision, [contact me](mailto:garbados@gmail.com).

## Details

**How often can I get a clue from the same investigator?**

Once every 24 hours. So, you can get one from Joe on your commute every day you ride together.

**How do clues help me?**

Clues provide the details, motives, and alibis that will ultimately solve your cases. Once you've solved a case, your next clue begins the next case.
