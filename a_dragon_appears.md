# A Dragon Appears

A roleplaying game for when-the-duck-ever

## Story

A dragon appears. Or maybe you're a glass of water. Or maybe you and a few friends are getting tipsy at the bar. Oh wait that's really happening.

It's a simple game, really. You could play it in your basement (as is traditional), in the bar (as is drunken), on the go (as the creators did), or in a car's back seat (as the creators' girlfriends disapproved of thoroughly). Play it wherever. It's about having a good time, about being silly and creative, and sharing a narrative experience. Whoa, that sounded heavy. Roll to see if it makes sense.

## Gameplay

Like most roleplaying systems, you have your players, and your GM, AKA Game Master, Giggly Marxist, Gargantuan Macchiato, etc. Your GM comes up with a prompt and preps themselves to reply to answers like "I want to tickle the minotaur." while the players write some number of adjectives (say, 3 to 5) on a napkin, their arms, someone else's face, or maybe they just memorize them. These adjectives can be anything, including but not limited to: "pudgy", "energetic", "radioactive", "invincible", or "can cause puppies to appear at will." Wherever these adjectives help the character, they're at an advantage. If the player opts to be harmed by his adjective (as adjectives like "cowardly" or "premature ejaculation" are wont to do) they score a story point.

Story points can be used to twist and add to the GM's narration. Maybe you know that ogre from gradeschool, or the hot princess has a total thing for your unibrow. Especially implausible alterations might take additional story points, though the group is free to reduce how many points an alteration requires based on how much they like it. Maybe the GM knows where the story is going and doesn't want to get de-railed. In that case, they're free to raise the cost of alterations as they see fit. But the wise GM would do well to remember that games are about fun, and that a focus on story should never come at the cost of the group's satisfaction.

Conflict resolution happens one of two ways: the GM decides, or leaves it to chance. Sometimes, events wouldn't really make sense if they happen any other way. It's theoretically possible, and sometimes narratively compelling, if the wimpling nerdface beats strongman muscleguy at arm wrestling, but sometimes that possibility isn't one anyone wants to explore. In that case, it's totally acceptable for the GM to simply dictate how things happen. Other times, the GM either won't have an outcome pre-determined, or they and the group will want to see how things turn out when left to chance. In that case, the GM roughs out the general odds of the conflict, taking into account how apt either party is in the conflict, and turns those into odds for some game of chance. The creators' favorites are rock/paper/scissors, but any game of 50/50 chance will do just fine. Assign either party their odds -- that is, how many times they need to win to gain victory in the conflict -- and go at it. The dynamics of this resolution can provide insight into how the conflict itself is resolved: say one side with good odds is arrogant, but ends up losing. Perhaps that arrogance was the cause of their demise in-game, even if in reality such behavior has no bearing on rock/paper/scissors. Other good games of chance include flipping coins. Even card games like Poker and Blackjack can be used, if you've got the time and materials for it.

## Acknowledgements

This game wouldn't be possible without the months of feedback I recieved from friends like Stephen Murphy, Spencer Madison, Peter Sarasohn, Lewis Coates, Andrew Veen, Kenneth Martin, Mitchell Tilghman Hall, and family members like my mom and dad. I also attribute my little brother Jamie Thayer (AKA Jim Jam, Jimalim, Thurgak) with the name and the original motivation for the game's ultimate form: a simple and impromptu roleplaying system.
