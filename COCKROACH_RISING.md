COCKROACH RISING
A post-apocalyptic RTS of miniscule proportions

[Story]
IN 2048, THE WORLD ENDS. Mankind's precarious control of its own power at last slips, and in a matter of days, civilization is wiped away in radioactive ash and fire. From the rubble creep no survivors -- at least, not human ones. Cockroaches, resistant to the radiation and resilient against the elements, rise from the wastes and survey a new world -- their world. With most of life on earth gone, they are free of predators, and all the spoils of the earth are free to them for the taking. As a cockroach, it falls to you to grow fat upon the remains of society, and pass your superior genes on to future generations, who will go on to reclaim the world, for cockroach-kind.

[Gameplay]

Compete with other cockroaches for control of various resources, such as organic remains, which you'll use to breed your descendents and send them into battle against other, inferior cockroach hordes.

As you progress, you gain Evolution Points, which you use to develop and advance your genes. These allow your cockroaches to move faster, hit harder, breed quicker, and other, more bizarre abilities, such as gaining powers from toxic waste. 

Early on, toxic waste is dangerous. It hurts you! However, some evolutionary tracks change how it affects you. Some make you more resistant, to the point that it will actually heal your units, while others will supercharge your units (even as it hurts them) or change their attacks (PSYCHIC COCKROACHES). As the game progresses, your relationship to toxic waste will change depending on your evolution.

Cockroach combat is simple. Select a cockroach, or a group of them, and drag your mouse to create a path for them to take. If they encounter an enemy, they'll attempt to attack it, whether you want them to or not. Cockroaches have hit areas: they're most defended on the front, less on the sides, least in the back. This makes tactical positioning important.
