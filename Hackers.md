HACKERS
"A determined adversary will not stop until they are successful."

You are a hacker, a cybersecurity expert. Through your fingertips flows mastery over every machine across every interface. There is no system that will not bend to your will - save other hackers.

Enter the End of Days, a cyberpunk dystopia where advances in behavioral science have allowed businesses and governments alike to command their people as controlled variables in vast and omniscient formulas. The masters of society perpetuate ignorance to imprison every level of society.

Web-linked technology now permeates every corner of civilization. A typical citizen cannot travel five feet from his or her house without being identified at least two ways: by corporations hawking goods through individualized advertisements, the targets of which having been spotted and tracked by concealed cameras and intelligences; and by public bodies tracking the movement of people and goods through a vast network of roving machines. Even the cleaning machines have eyes.

Luckily, you are no typical citizen. You are a hacker. You know where these cameras are concealed, and how to avoid them; you know the codes to neutralize your presence in the eyes of simple machines; you may even know the seven words that bend any will.

There are many hackers these days, with information such a hot commodity. But you are the cream of the crop, the best of the best. Script kiddies crack ATMs and get caught. As if by sheer force of charisma, you unlock even the most secure installations, and entering like a whisper and leaving like a shadow. Your presence is known only when and where you allow it to be.

Your existence is mythic, which makes you a target. Corporations want you in their ranks, or they want you dead. Governments want you brought to justice for evading their reach. This brings us to the crux of your dilemma in life:

You are a god of machines. Wherever you put your mind, the world will bend. But, wherever the world bends, your foes will know that you have been. Given this, how do you act?

PLAYING THE GAME
Characters have five stats: Offense, Defense, and Social, as skills; Motive and History as backstory and character description.

All skills begin with two dice, which can then be augmented by dividing six more dice among them as the hacker chooses. It is assumed that hackers can achieve any simple technological task without even trying, so these skills are invoked mostly when contesting other hackers or the systems they've developed -- or, in the case of Social, human beings with anything more than the barest hint of sense. On the other hand, hackers are assumed to be physically inept, and are thus extremely vulnerable to things like guns, knives, and large burly people.

Motive is your character's "why" to life. It may be a moral statement, or it may be an explicit goal. Why do you keep from giving into the consumer orgy that envelopes the rest of the masses? They seem so happy, too... All hackers have a motive, which their players compose at character creation.

History is your characters backstory. How did they learn to hack? Where did they cut their teeth on the stuff? Did you make any enemies? Any friends? Who are you indebted to? Like motive, all hackers have a history, which their players compose at character creation.

Offense -- Ability to negotiate systems, to "pop" them.
	The heart of any hacker operation lies in the hacker's ability to negotiate, enter, and manipulate ostensibly secure systems. This represents your ability to do just that.
Defense -- Ability to evade technological detection.
	Secrecy is safety. Breaking in is one thing, but getting out without a trace is another entirely. In this day and age, you can't even pick up a phone without being traced -- unless you know how.
Social -- Ability to "hack" human beings.
	The truth speaks for itself, but in its absense we are left only with hearsay. Demonstrate truth, and you set the people free. Spin yarns, and you bind them in lies.
