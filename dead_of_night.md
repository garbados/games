title: Dead of Night
summary: Inspired by Dread, though at the time I only knew it as "that game that uses Jenga instead of dice."

## How to Play

You'll need a Master of Rituals (who tells the story and runs the game), a Jenga tower, and at least one other player.

Each player then creates their character, by making note somewhere of their Name, Profession(s), and Flaw. Each of those fields is detailed in the Fields section.

Then, the game begins. The Master of Rituals sets the scene, introduces the character(s), and gives them a clue to what they need to find to survive this ordeal. The game ends when all the characters are dead, or game's nightmare has been resolved.

## Characters

### Name

What shall we call you?

### Profession(s)

Professions are skillsets that aide you, like "detective", "bureaucrat", or "demon-hunter".

Players pick one profession for their character for quick games, or three for more involved ones.

Professions give -1 difficulty where they apply and can stack. However, you can't take a single profession more than once.

### Flaw

What scares you? What will the darkness use against you?

Roleplay your flaw well to earn story points. Flaws preferably indicate a Secret, an Addiction, or a Fear.

Horrific elements of the game can and should exploit your flaw. +2 difficulty to act in the face of your flaw. Gain story points for indulging it.

### Story Points

Story points can be used to conjure small but critical items and elements, such as a crowbar to defend yourself or wardrobe to block a door. They can also be used to avoid taking blocks off the tower, effectively acting as a +1 whenever you need it. Players don't start with any story points, but the Master of Rituals should award you with them for exemplary roleplaying.
	
## Task Resolution

Tasks are resolved using a jenga tower. When characters attempt difficult or trying tasks, they must remove a number of blocks from the jenga tower equal to its difficulty minus the player's bonus. If the player's bonus is greater than the difficulty, they don't need to remove blocks.

When the tower falls over, the character whose player toppled it dies. Monsters overwhelm him, he falls down the pit, or he goes insane -- whatever works for the story. Reconstruct the tower and continue without that player. Or, they come back to act against the party. These dead characters gain one story point each turn with which to hinder and harm the remaining survivors. 

### Difficulty

1. Easy
2. Difficult
3. Hard
4. Impossible
	
## Causing Harm

Normal humans have ten health. When they run out of health, they die.

To try harming something, indicate what you're harming. Pull out a number of blocks equal to the amount of damage you want to deal, minus any bonuses.

Add bonuses from weapons, etc., afterward. +1 for anything dangerous, like a chair leg. +2 for actual weapons.

Defenders can pull blocks to reduce damage at a 1:1 ratio. But mind you, if the tower falls, you simply die, instead of suffering damage.
