title: The Time When
summary: Adventurers, tell your tale! A nontraditional storytelling game.

An aged scholar approaches your band of travelers at a pub. "I know you!" he exclaims.

"As well you may," one of your companions replies, "We're rather well known in some parts. You might be...?"

"Rel Wilcox, Lore Keeper. I'd like to chronicle your adventures, if you'd be willing to recant them."

"I think we might be amenable to that..." you say, tapping your empty flagon.

"Excellent! Barkeep, a round for the table!" Rel sits down with you, flipping open a tome of blank pages. "Where shall we begin?"

## Overview

The Time When is a storytelling game where adventurers share their epic tales with scholars, travelers, barkeeps... really, whoever wants to know!

## How to Play

First, pick the Audience. This can be one or more people. They listen to the adventurers tell their tale, and help keep the story straight. This involves:

* **Chronicling events**, and letting the adventurers know when there's a contradiction or reminding them of their exploits' details.
* Taking notes on the adventurers' characters within the story, and **validating claims**.
* Asking questions, sometimes leading ones, that **keep the story moving**.
* **Awarding tokens** for good storytelling.

Then, pick the Adventurers. This can be one or more people. They tell the story that the audience has come to hear. This role involves only telling a good story, with the help of your compatriots.

Each adventurer starts with five tokens (whose uses are explored in Details), and each member of the audience should start with pen and paper. After that, the adventurers start recanting, the audience starts chronicling, and you're already on your way.

## Details

### How To Audience

The audience has three responsibilities, explored in greater detail below.

#### Chronicling Events

At least one member of the audience should be armed with pen and paper, for taking down the events and details of the adventurer's story. Imagine that you're going to compose these notes into an article, book, or history. If the adventurers say something that seems to contradict your notes, bring it up: "But, didn't you...?" "How could you do that, if you'd already...?" "But you'd killed them!" This will either inspire the adventurers to offer more detail, force them to revise their story, or illuminate the party's character as they twist the tale to their own ends.

The party can also ask the audience to remind them of details, in case they forget. "Where did we meet...?" "Didn't we encounter them before...?" "What did he say about...?"

#### Validating Claims

If an adventurer not particularly known for his strength claims to have lifted a whole tree, you're going to be skeptical. For this reason, the audience keeps track of each adventurer's characteristics and abilities throughout the story, and checks it against the challenge at hand. If it makes sense, hooray! If not, make a stink. "That's impossible!" "How could you have accomplished that?" "Nonsense."

Adventurers build their characters by spending tokens, buying descriptors and equipment of varying degrees. See `Tokens: Traits` for more details of how adventurers buy traits. Your job as audience is to log and adjust these abilities as they evolve, and inform the adventurers of how they stack up against challenges. "A dragon! It seems quite a bit stronger than any of you alone..." "Lizardfolk! That seems like a fair match." "A puppy? You challenged a puppy to a duel?"

#### Keeping the Story Moving

Sometimes, the adventurers may not know what to do next -- I mean, what they did next. If this happens, help 'em out! "From there, you must have been able to see the Synagogue of Gloria. What was it like?" You can also use these opportunities to close up plot holes ("Did you ever find out why your muscles grew so suddenly?") or address things the adventurers may have foreshadowed ("You said that wasn't the last time you met...").

#### Awarding Tokens

### How To Adventurer

First, you get ten tokens. You spend tokens to improve your abilities in the story, and receive them from the audience for telling a good story. See ``Tokens`` for more on how they work.

Then, you start telling the story.

### Tokens

Tokens are the currency of **The Time When**. The audience uses them to reward the adventurers for telling a good story, and the adventurers spend them to improve their characters.

#### Acquiring / Spending tokens

Adventurers start the game with ten tokens. You can adjust this number, depending on how epic you want the adventurers to be when they start the story. Tokens can be spent anytime, whether in conversation, in combat, even while sleeping, but the adventurer should work it into the story. "My muscles grew overnight!" could be a great plot hook, for example, but feels like a copout if it doesn't tie into anything.

The audience awards tokens to adventurers for a story well told. Climactic moments, cathartic resolutions, eloquent descriptions, and more can all earn tokens. It's up to the audience! Tokens can be awarded anytime.

#### Traits

Adventurers can spend tokens to improve their traits, whether this means becoming more skilled or acquiring superior equipment. Traits can be any descriptor, from "strong" to "magical" to "smelly", and apply anywhere they make sense (which is ultimately up to the audience). Traits occur in degrees, from uncommon to impossible. You're assumed to be of unremarkable ability in any trait you don't have, though weaknesses are narratively compelling (and thus might convince the audience to award you tokens!).

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Cost</th>
    <th>Degree</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Uncommon</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>Exceptional</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>Incredible</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>Mythic</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>Impossible</td>
  </tr>
</table>

To acquire a trait at any degree, you must acquire all previous degrees of that trait. So, if you wanted an incredible degree of majesty, you'd need to spend 2 tokens to get uncommon majesty, then 4 for exceptional majesty, and finally six for incredible majesty, for a cost of 12 total.

If your trait is of a higher degree than a challenge's degree, you win! If it's higher than your trait, you can rock/paper/scissors a member of the audience to improve your trait: you need to win a number of rounds equal to the difference, but a single loss instills the audience with a feeling that you weren't up to the task. You can also describe the scene in greater detail to illucidate any circumstances that may have acted in your factor, such as the position of the sun, a little-known weakness of your foe, etc.
