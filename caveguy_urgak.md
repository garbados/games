summary: Need work together for survive.

## Overview

Ug. Me Urgak. You new here. This Urgak tribe.

Urgak tribe want food. Want home. Want tools. Want talk good.

If Urgak tribe survive, it because Urgak tribe work together -- even if no can talk good.

## Gameplay

One am Game Master. Or GM. Else am cavefolk.

Game Master can talk good. Cavefolk no can.

### Playing cavefolk

You cavefolk. Pick name and six words. That all can say. Can gesture. Sixth word, whole tribe can say.

Other cavefolk do same. Can have same words. Can say all names.

After win big challenge, and Game Master say OK, learn new word, or teach tribe old word.

### Playing the Game Master

The GM describes the world, and plays the part of people and things that aren't players. Cavefolk are beset by the elements, other tribes, hunger, disease, babies, weather, etc. You are the arbiter of these elements, and interpret the party's attempts to communicate. Feel free to exploit imprecision: if a cavefolk says, "Urgak get food!" feel free to reply, "How?"

If the cavefolk can effectively communicate their intentions, those intentions come to pass. Thus, accomplishing harder tasks requires more specification from the cavefolk. If a cavefolk says, "Urgak don tunic!", that's probably not so hard. But if they say, "Urgak kill bear!", that's going to need a lot more detail.

After major accomplishments -- like getting a big beast of prey's carcass back to the tribe, or finding the cure for some ailment -- every cavefolk learns a new word. Or, instead of learning a new word, they can choose to teach an old word to the whole tribe.
