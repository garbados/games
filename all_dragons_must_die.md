title: All Dragons Must Die

All Dragons Must Die (ADMD), like its parent A Dragon Appears (ADA), is a supremely simple but mostly traditional roleplaying game. One player, called the game master or GM, administers the game for another group of players. The game is built for quick deployment on simple settings, making it great for creative but new or inexperienced roleplayers, or game masters looking for quick practice. More experienced groups will enjoy house rules like "story points" which leverage the group's combined intelligence to create complex and involved worlds and stories.

## Quickstart

## Characters, pt 1: Basics

Characters in ADMD are built from the following:

* Name: your character's name, title, callsign, etc.
* Backgrounds: skills, talents, and professions, whether current or former, that inform what your character is capable of. Backgrounds are qualified by their rank, which is a number indicating skill, effectiveness, efficiency, etc.
* Gear: items, tools, equipment, armaments, and the like, which both enhance and expand your knowledge and abilities. Alternatively, gear might be mundane items that, though functionally useless, may still be very valuable. When and how gear can be used, and how effective it actually is, is often up to the group's discretion.

## Characters, pt 2: Derived Stats

Several features of your character are derived from your background:

* Level: the sum of your character's backgrounds' ranks. Whenever you level up, you gain another rank to a background (or a new background, where you've effectively gone from rank 0 to rank 1). Conversely, if you gain a background, you level up.
* HP: hit points, or how much damage you can take before going unconscious. Your maximum HP is equal to 2+(2*level).
  * At 0 HP, you go unconscious. But at -1 * maximum HP, you die.
  * When you level up, you gain 2 HP.
  * You recover 1 HP for every day of rest, or 2 HP if in good care.
  * Your current HP can never exceed your maximum, except temporarily by virtue of effects like painkillers or magic.

[HOUSE RULE] Sanity: your grip on reality, as established by your breadth of perspective. Your sanity, then, is equal at most to your number of distinct backgrounds, and is at least zero. Traumatic or horrifying events diminish sanity. Peace and understanding restore it. When it runs out, your character goes insane. The game master may suddenly take control of your character, or privately make you privy to campaign information of an utterly maddening nature. Certain foes or effects may capitalize on your mental health, whether good or bad. Sanity is great in certain horror campaigns, such as those where fear is curried from the unknown, particularly the unknown that you want to stay that way.

## Characters, pt 3: Checks

Your character "checks" his or her (or its) abilities against a static force, like a wall or lock. Checks are in contrast to contests, where your character and another (or several) dynamic force(s) "contest" one another.

In a check, as a player, pick the backgrounds and the gear that help you solve the task at hand. ADMD encourages you to tell the tale of your attempt, and in doing so add detail to your character and gravity to the story. This also helps the game master and other players understand how the things you selected apply to the task at hand. 

### Example

Take Durdassil, the Dread Pirate for example. He's got Pirate [2], Soldier [1], Thief [1] for backgrounds. Faced with a locked door...

  > "I've been down this road before. I take out my tools, quietly mind you, and size up my foe. I slide in first one tool, then the next, feeling for tumblers, locking them in place as I go. A thief lives by his ability to get into -- and out of -- wherever he should not be."

Durdassil has pretty clearly chosen to use his Thief background. A loving game master may want to reward players who roleplay their character -- maybe not just like how Durdassil's player does it, but in whatever way pleases the group and enhances the game -- by addings mods to the check that make it easier. A mod is a number added to the check that makes it easier or harder. Mods represent the difficulty of the task combined with circumstantial or environment factors, plus or minus whatever else the game master / group sees fit. Let's say that this is a pretty typical lock, so it doesn't get a mod, but the game master likes Durdassil's roleplaying, so he gets a +1 on top of his Thief background and lockpicks.

Durdassil has 1 rank in Thief, and his lockpicks add another +1, for a +3 total so far.

Now, roll 2d6 -- that is, two six-sided dice. Durdassil needs to roll less than 6 plus his bonuses. 6 is the default task difficulty; lower means more difficult, higher means easier. In formula: "If 2d6 < difficulty + bonuses, character succeeds."
