SOULBOUND
An RPG about too many cooks in not enough kitchen.
[Concept comes from Asylumrunner, circa indie-rpgs.com]
[Check http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=30030.0 for backstory]
[This doc is mostly for mechanics]

Dice
	As ADMD

Husk Characteristics
	Because the husk is the body, its characteristics are mostly physical.
	Roll randomly. Fk point buy. If you need another body, go fking find it.
	Or, I guess, if you really want, craft the husk as a group.
	GMs! Don't forget the backstory!
	DURABILITY
		HP, innate armor, and damage.
		Roll 1d6 or assign based on context. HP is double that.
	BOONS
		Husks have one boon.
	FLAWS
		Husks have one flaw.
		
Soul Characteristics
	Soul Attributes
		Divvy four points between these two attributes. Intelligence starts at 1, Control at 0.
		Intelligence
			Determines # of professions
		Control
			Command the husk longer and grab control from others more easily.
			Controlling the husk imposes a penalty based on duration.
			Resting, e.g. not controlling the husk, diminishes the penalty.
			-1 every 10 minutes of control, +1 every 10 minutes of rest.
			Can only attempt to wrest control once every ten minutes.
			In the Abyss, Control is your durability.
	Boons
		As in ADMD, three at start.
	Flaws
		As in ADMD, three at start.
	Professions
		Like ADMD, but you have a number of professions equal to your intelligence. The idea if that these are the things you remember from your life, or maybe that you learned in the afterlife, or perhaps in a husk. As in life, you forget things, and can only really -know- so much. Professions carry a bonus equal to your level. Professions include magical knowledge, with magical "professions" having names like "occultist", "shaman", "sorcerer", and other terms to that effect. Each uses the same magic system, but has different mundane purviews.
		
Advancement
	Every once in a while, after a momentus adventure, your soul will "level up" the next time it gets some R&R. This is an opportunity to reflect on its experiences and absorb their gravity and meaning. For the player, this means your professions become more potent, and your ability to control husks improves. Your level is a bonus to both of these things.
	
Magic
	Soulbound concieves of the Abyss as a sort of Alice in Wonderland-like plane, a dream made mostly nightmare by the Damned. Like lucid dreaming, souls in the abyss can learn to manipulate their environment as if by sorcery, and some of that power carries over into the mortal realm when the soul finds a husk. Magic in the mortal realm is like speaking through water.
	Even so, souls in husk can do it, if they trained for it. In the Abyss, your magic skill is equal to your level plus relevant professions, while in the mortal realm, only relevant professions carry over.
	Casting takes about three seconds of concentration, though the execution of the spell need not have any motion or sound to it. Generally, you cast on objects by touching them, though placing your hands near them works too. You can double casting time to gain an additional level for the purpose of casting -- for example, if you're casting on the mortal plane, and you've got professions like Occultist and Hypnotist (both pseudo-magical), an additional level would confer a +2, one for each profession.
	MELT
		Cause an object to melt away at your touch, like water, or liquid glass, or light warping around your hand until it dissipates into oblivion. The aesthetics of melting objects, really, is up to you.
		DC7+3x, where x is how many pounds of material you're attempting to melt.
	MAKE
		Like a rabbit from a hat, so appears precisely what you need. Perhaps you look one way and when you look back, there it is. Or maybe you pull it from behind someone's ear. Perhaps, with a wink, it simply -is-. Like melting, how an object is made is up to you.
		DC7+4x, where x is how many pounds of material you're trying to make. Raise x for additional complexity, like small moving parts or several distinct materials. In the Abyss, x refers to an object's usefulness. Creating a worthless trinket is easy, but creating the solution to the task at hand -- nightmares are never so easy.
	MORPH
		Transform rock to mud and back again as if playing with puddy. Guns become gummies when you grip them, noodles turn to wire under your touch, and water transforms into wine before the eyes of shocked spectators.
		DC7+xy, where x is how many pounds of material you're morphing, and y is the complexity of the change. Similar items, such as apple juice into orange juice or dirt into mud, isn't hard. Water to wine is a bit harder, rocks to dirt is more difficult, and guns to gummies is nigh impossible on the mortal plane.
	SHUNT
		In the Abyss, with all of its screwy half-there dimensions and nightmarish physics, the merest act of "pushing" someone can send them hurtling across its boggling depths like Alice tumbling down the rabbit hole. Such a power is one of the few defenses spirits have against the Damned while trapped in the Abyss. Though never fatal, shunting can buy you a few more precious minutes of -- whatever being a spirit is.
		On the mortal plane, shunting attempts to force a soul into the Abyss. Rather than inflict damage, it rattles the mortal coil in an attempt to shake the spirit from its earthly moors. How hard you rattle the cage determines both the difficulty of the shunting and the severity of its consequences.
		DC7+2x, where x is the target's current health, or rather, how much fortitude you figure you have to overcome. If you fail by 3 points or less, the target is stunned by the experience for 2d6 seconds. If you succeed on the mortal plane, the target's soul is shunted into the Abyss. (If you shunt a husk, the soul currently commanding it is shunted, and another takes control) If you succeed in the Abyss, the target is tossed across the Abyss' weird physics to someplace else. A target seeking you out will be able to find you again in 2d6 minutes, minus their level, plus your margin of success.
