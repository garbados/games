"Into The Wild"
A Survivalist RPG

The object of ITW is to impel the players with a sense of materialistic desperation balanced precariously against their need for cooperation. The elements are your enemy, as might be your fellow man. But only one of these can be made a friend.

Die: a single ruthless d4. Fail on rolls less than 0. Difficulty penalizes rolls, as does poor shape, hunger, etc.

	Disease
		Disease represents not just the afflictions of illnesses, but also your overall weakness as a result of malnutrition, abuse, and overexertion. Every three points of disease act as a constant -1. When rolling to avoid infection or to resist illness, every point of disease acts as a -1.
	Hunger
		Every four hours, you accumulate a hunger point, which acts as a -1 until sated. While sleeping, hunger does not accumulate. Eating things not meant for ingestion, like dirt (or worse) staves off hunger but shifts it doubly to Disease as your body weakens from the lack of nutrients. Eating poor food (raw meat, worms, brackish water) staves off hunger but shifts it to Disease. Eating good food (cooked, prepared for ingestion) staves off hunger. Eating very good food (a modern meal) staves off hunger and eliminates a point of Disease. Water (1 pint) can eliminate up to one hunger point each day.
		Every four hours, you accumulate a hunger point and a thirst point.

Cooperating: characters working together on a task combine their rolls.

Health: humans have 10 health naturally. They begin to die at 0 health, and die at -10. They heal one health each day naturally if above 0, or lose one each day if below. At 0, they are in helpless stasis.

Combat: attacks are naturally at -2. Sticks and rocks are -1. Real weapons are +0 and above. Most objects can be thrown short distances (up to 30 ft), but this doubles their penalty. Weapons designed for throwing suffer no penalty.
